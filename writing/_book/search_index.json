["iliad.html", " 2 Iliad", " 2 Iliad There is no place where one really feels at home anymore. So, the thing that one longs to get back to, before anything else, is whatever place there may be where one could feel at home, and that is because it is in that place - and in that place alone - where one would really like to feel at home. That place is the world of the Greeks. –Friedrich Nietzsche, The Will to Power: Attempt at a Revaluation of All Values (1885) "],
["resources.html", "2.1 Resources", " 2.1 Resources 2.1.1 English Translations and Audiobooks 2.1.1.1 Translated by Ian Johnson In Ian Johnson, free The audio version by Anton Lesser is in Naxos Audiobooks. This version is not as popular as the big three in Section 2.1.1.3. I put it on top because this is the most accessible Iliad I have even read and it’s FREE. Another bonus is the high quality unabridged audiobook. 2.1.1.2 Translated by Samuel Butler, Revised by Gregory Nagy et al. In Center For Hellenic Studies, free The only prose translation in this list. Used in a MOOC course of 2.1.2.1. One of the revisers Gregory Nagy said this revised translation aims to be as honest as possible to the original Greek text. 2.1.1.3 Translated by Robert Fagles In Amazon. This is arguably the best translation in the market considering the tradeoff of rigorousness and readability. It’s also the only print version I hold. The corresponding audiobook is abridged, unfortunately. This is the only drawback I think of using this version (not the version itself). Traditionally the other two strong competitive translations are Richmond Lattimore and Robert Fitzgerald. These two versions both have nice unabridged audiobooks: 2.1.1.4 Translated by Caroline Alexander In Amazon. There are dozens of modern translations of Iliad and the reason I single this new translation out is solely because, this is the very first female translation of Homer around the world! Currently I only read a fraction of her translation from one of her other books, The War That Killed Achilles. 2.1.2 Video Courses 2.1.2.1 The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours (Hour 1-8 ) In edX, taught by Gregory Nagy of Harvard University.
